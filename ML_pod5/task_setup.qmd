title: "Task: Setting up VS Code for Python"
---

## Objective

Set up and test your Python development environment in **VS Code** using a virtual environment.

---

## Step-by-step instructions

### 1. **Check your Python installation**  
   Open your terminal and verify that Python is installed:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

### 2.	**Install VS Code extensions**
Open VS Code and install the following:
	•	Python extension
	•	Jupyter extension

### 3.	**Create and activate a virtual environment**

In the terminal (inside your project folder), run:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # macOS/Linux
```
OR
```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1    # Windows
```
Then install a few essential packages:
```bash
pip install jupyter numpy scikit-learn matplotlib pandas
```

### 4.	**Test Python and NumPy in the terminal**

Launch Python from within your activated environment and check:

```bash
import numpy as np
print(np.__version__)
```

### 5.	**Test in VS Code using a Python script**
	•	Create a new file called test.py
	•	Add the following code:

```bash
import numpy as np
print("NumPy works!", np.__version__)
```

### 6.	**Test in a Jupyter Notebook**
	•	Create a new notebook named test.ipynb
	•	In the first cell, add:

```bash
import numpy as np
np.random.rand(3)
```
•	Run the cell and confirm it executes successfully.

### 7. 	**(Optional) Try running in Google Colab**
Upload your test.ipynb to Google Colab.
In the first cell, install NumPy and run:

```bash
!pip install numpy
import numpy as np
print("NumPy works in Colab!", np.__version__)
```
