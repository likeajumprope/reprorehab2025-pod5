# More sophisticated models using sci-kit learn

Sklearn provides access to a variety of clustering algorithms

1. MiniBatch K-Means
- How it Works: MiniBatch K-Means is a variant of K-Means that uses small random batches of the data to perform clustering updates, making it faster and more memory-efficient than regular K-Means.
- Mechanism: The algorithm randomly samples small batches of data points in each iteration, computes cluster assignments, and updates centroids based on the sample.
- Use Case: Best for clustering large datasets where traditional K-Means would be too slow or memory-intensive.

2. Affinity Propagation
- How it Works: Affinity Propagation doesn’t require a predefined number of clusters. Instead, it uses a similarity matrix to identify exemplars (representative points for each cluster).
- Mechanism: Points communicate through "messages" in a matrix until they converge on exemplars, using parameters like damping and preference to adjust message influence and cluster count.
- Use Case: Suitable for data with well-defined clusters where the number of clusters isn’t known beforehand, but computationally intensive on large datasets.
3. MeanShift
- How it Works: MeanShift clusters points by iteratively moving towards the densest regions, identifying clusters as peaks in data density.
- Mechanism: The bandwidth parameter controls the neighborhood size. Points are pulled towards their local density center, and clusters form around these peaks.
- Use Case: Good for finding arbitrarily shaped clusters without needing to set a fixed number of clusters, but slow with high-dimensional data.
4. Spectral Clustering
- How it Works: Spectral Clustering applies eigenvalue decomposition to a similarity matrix to reduce dimensions and enhance separability before applying clustering.
- Mechanism: Constructs a similarity (affinity) matrix of the data, reduces dimensions with eigenvectors, and clusters the data based on these new dimensions.
- Use Case: Suitable for data with complex, non-convex shapes but computationally expensive on large datasets due to matrix decomposition.
5. Ward’s Agglomerative Clustering
- How it Works: Ward’s method is a hierarchical clustering approach that starts with each data point as its own cluster, then merges pairs of clusters to minimize variance.
- Mechanism: The algorithm iteratively merges clusters to minimize the within-cluster variance, based on linkage (distance between clusters).
- Use Case: Works well with small to medium-sized datasets where clusters have a clear hierarchy; not ideal for very large datasets due to high computational complexity.
6. Agglomerative Clustering (Average Linkage)
- How it Works: Another hierarchical approach, it merges clusters based on average linkage, which minimizes the average pairwise distance between clusters.
- Mechanism: Begins with each data point in its own cluster, then iteratively merges clusters based on the average distance between all pairs of points in different clusters.
- Use Case: Useful for hierarchical clustering when clusters are of varying sizes or non-convex shapes.
7. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- How it Works: DBSCAN forms clusters based on the density of points, where points in dense regions are considered part of the same cluster, and outliers are marked separately.
- Mechanism: Uses two parameters, eps (maximum distance between points) and min_samples (minimum number of points in a neighborhood), to form clusters based on point density.
- Use Case: Effective for identifying clusters of varying shapes and sizes with noise/outliers, especially in spatial data.
8. OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure)
- How it Works: OPTICS is similar to DBSCAN but more flexible in finding clusters with varying densities by generating an ordering of points and cluster reachability distances.
- Mechanism: Unlike DBSCAN, it doesn’t produce explicit clusters initially but instead creates an ordered list of points with reachability distances that can later be clustered based on density.
- Use Case: Useful for data with clusters of varying density, as it can adaptively adjust for different densities and still handle noise well.
9. BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies)
- How it Works: BIRCH builds a tree structure of data points, clustering as it builds, making it efficient for large datasets.
- Mechanism: Uses a tree structure called a Clustering Feature Tree to incrementally cluster incoming points based on a predefined threshold for cluster compactness.
- Use Case: Ideal for large datasets where a single pass through the data is beneficial, but may struggle with clusters of varying densities.
10. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
- How it Works: GMM assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions and uses Expectation-Maximization (EM) to estimate the parameters.
- Mechanism: GMM represents clusters as Gaussian distributions and iteratively refines cluster assignments by maximizing likelihood, allowing for flexible cluster shapes.
- Use Case: Best for data that roughly follows a Gaussian distribution; works well on data where clusters may overlap but can be slow on large datasets.
