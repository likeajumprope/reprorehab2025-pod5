title: "Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab"
---

Alternatively, if you want to use Python **without worrying about installing libraries or managing dependencies**, you can use **Jupyter notebooks** and run them directly in **Google Colab** — a free, cloud-based platform provided by Google.

---

## 1. What is Google Colab?

Google Colab (short for *Collaboratory*) is a cloud service that lets you run Jupyter notebooks in your browser,   with no local setup required.

**Key advantages:**
- No need to install Python or libraries.
- Access to free GPUs and TPUs for computation.
- Direct integration with Google Drive for storage.
- Same syntax and workflow as local Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files).

You can think of it as “Jupyter Notebook in the cloud.”

## 2. How to open a notebook in Colab

### Option A – Start from scratch

1. Go to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)  
2. Choose **File → New notebook**.  
3. A notebook with a Python 3 runtime will open in your browser.  
4. You can rename it and save it to your Google Drive.

### Option B – Open an existing notebook

If you already have a `.ipynb` file:

1. Upload it to Google Drive.  
2. Right-click → **Open with → Google Colaboratory**.  
   (If Colab isn’t listed, choose *Connect more apps* → search for *Colaboratory*.)  
3. Alternatively, you can drag-and-drop a notebook directly into an open Colab window.

## 3. Installing additional libraries

Colab comes pre-installed with most scientific packages (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.).  

To install any additional packages, use `pip` directly in a cell:

```python
!pip install seaborn xgboost shap
```
